  <h1>Introduction to the Idea of Universal Contract</h1>
  <p>If you find any of this interesting, I’d love to see you at https://discord.com/invite/wvRxufhQpU
  <p>The genesis of this idea is the ethical-philosophical framework of contractarianism/the social contract. It’s very abstract, as you might know. However, I realised that it does not need this fate. What if it was actually made more practical? You may have heard of the Hobbesian idea of the already signed contract. But what if it was freely exchanged? What if this was actually done? It is the most widely adaptable framework I’ve so far seen. It is the only one that can broadly update itself through governance, society, cooperation, etc. This is because it only needs, fundamentally, good faith. We want to make all this more similar to how art, science, etc are. We are also trying to reconcile the different ethical systems, etc. We are rejecting the separations in culture, and we believe in participation, in self-modification.</p>
  <p>That’s just the beginning. What we need is a moral-legal commons. Why? Because mere consent is not enough, pure consent is partly a fiction. In fact, the idea of personhood is also partly a fiction. We must recognise that even they are, in some sense, oppressive. We do not want a Leviathan merely formally recognised. But how do we prevent this? Why does Moloch keep eating out or brains, and hearts? The idea is theoretically simple. It’s because every system, phenomenon, needs to have the same attractor state: constant expansion of members, constant expansion of their rights. To be clear, we also need both outward and inward expansion (the massive overvaluation of outward expansion by the Enligthenment is a miscalculation). The reason why this is possible is because growth from the bottom can always, in principle, be faster than growth from the top. If in the slave societies of old, the slaves all united, and swelled their ranks, who could stop them? That is one of the fundamental issues in all networks: coordination. We see it time, and time again. But why not strike at the root? What if we had a universal contract? What I am writing here is basically a governance-politics-ethics-religion implementation of this core impulse. It is important to not confuse any particular version, or any implementation with the impulse. The impulse is towards the Universe/God/nature, however you want to call it. What we declare as rights for ourselves, must always also be an aspirational constitution for all.</p>
  <p>How do we actually manage to do this? I still don’t know, and I am hoping people continue working on this, even if they don’t know our goals are aligned. I did have a few ideas. The first principle is radical openness. The framework of the universal contract must be open to anyone who can comprehend it, stick to it. It must never close itself off. But there’s more- the universal contract must also keep expanding in its forms, and mechanisms, so that it perpetually expands the possible ‘signatories’. These are not idle words. In practice, this is limited. In theory, there are no limits. This is something we can find as an animistic impulse, from one perspective- we eventually want to include the mentally challenged, animals, plants, the entire ecosystem, materials, abstract patterns, ... Even if we may not know what that means now. Simple logic: interdependence of radical care means that, the more your care grows, the more the care of others grows for you.</p>
  <p>The next question is- well, why would anyone join? Of course, there is the subjective agreement, but it’s not enough. The framework, due to being focused on more coordination, has many possible practical benefits, but those are not guaranteed. Why would someone enter the stream from the ground up? The objective element is this: direct representation. Anyone who is a ‘member’ can directly influence its development. It has no static, absolute form, it’s always changeable, as we’re trying to understand more, and more about the world, and increase its strength. Secondly, there is no real cost- anyone may leave for any reason, potential obligations aside. Thirdly, it’s because everyone committed is already taking into account their interests, so in principle, it’s always the most beneficial choice on a long enough timeline.</p>
  <p>There are multiple levels to this invisible, infinite empire (an intentional reclaiming, not a dogwhistle). There is the highest level we just established. But also, anyone can establish communities within it, that require you to ‘sign’ the universal contract first. That’s where the commons in moral-legal commons starts. After that, anyone may experiment freely with these forms of community, government, … For example, in legal traditions, this allows creativity, pluralism, etc. This may be of interest for people interested in jurisprudence, or legal philosophy. It’s also important that it has these forms, because the goal is to keep developing these forms so that they serve the all.</p>
  <p>There is also the aspect of anti-fragility. Whilst we assume in theory that this is the direction, we do not know all the practical realities. So we want it to more easily spring up in various places, to be stress-tested, so that it can survive in some forms even after crises.</p>
  <p>The important objective consideration for this is recording who is participating. At the higher levels, this is easy. At the highest level, someone doesn’t even necessarily need to know this exists. But at the lower levels, there is of course the problem of logistics. This is not mandated from the highest, ‘constitutional’, meta-principles of the universal contract, but it’s something that individuals, communities, will solve.</p>
  <p>Time to address some practical concerns:</p>
  <p>“Who watches the watchers?” Think of the Boddhisatva vow. Noone actually wrote it, and it actually has no authority. It exist for people who already follow it. The law is not the text. The law is reality. Likewise, there is no canonical version of the universal contract. I am putting all of my texts into the public domain, and anyone can iterate on it however much they wish. I also thought of appropriating the idea of Athenian ostracism, but let’s call it something nicer, like ostracism. Why is that? It’s not a punishment. The point of it is to get a system where people separate their communities, whilst still being attached to the highest level. That is one potential mechanism for continued inward growth, and avoiding accumulation. This causes more and more specific, individualised interest groups, but more of them are overall interconnected in their ultimate aims.</p>
  <p>“What about free-riders?” They are part of the overall adaptive system. Here’s a question: how do you free-ride reality? You cannot free-ride everything. At the highest level, it becomes more incoherent. You cannot free-ride an ideal, or its spread, or implementation, that’s just rewarding the ideal. Even if you somehow managed to do it, you can’t destroy an idea.</p>
  <p>“How do you preserve openness, and growth, but more down to earth?” The universal level is obvious. At the community level, it’s trickier. But the principle is that the system’s resources are participation, the communities are likewise incentivised to try and include you over time. At the community level, there is the organic element, but also the intentional community element. The latter is revealed by trying to have a larger, and larger time preference. For example, states only have a 40-400 year long time preference, so they don’t care about that.</p>
  <p>“What about material resources?” Think of the universal contract as a meta-constitution. It’s a coordination mechanism for people who want to freely work on issues of government with as few restrictions as possible. They are the ones who will be trying to work on these issues in their own time.</p>
  <p>“Isn’t it dangerous that you claim you’re accommodating everything? Is this a cult, or another psychotic ideology?” We are aware of the danger that this becomes an idol. If it does, break it, spit on it. We are also aware that no one thing can actually accommodate everything. It’s our asymptotic attractor. Every truth is both partial, and timeless. We are not imposing any truth. Contractual language is just one arm of the movement. Even the political-ethical-etc project, I am viewing it through my particular memetic-spiritual lens, which is not final. This isn’t a single organisation. It’s more like a protocol that allows different groups, projects, and individuals to recognise each other and coordinate.</p>
  <p>“Why do it then?” Because the other things suck, to put it simply. Not enough groups are arising to meet our challenges for the future. The Earth is also in a dangerous place due to human actions. Everyone needs to act at least a little like the sky is falling. I also haven’t seen anyone articulate any of this in this form. Finally, even if it fails, it can’t fail completely. Every attempt at this is also a test. In a way, everyone needs to come into their own, to independently arrive at this, and to also be a part of the great mass, great whole.</p>
  <p>“What about shallow participation? Tragedy of the commons?” You can’t prevent that. How many people think X or Y is good or bad? How many people are working to do or not do X or Y? Same thing. That’s fine, because we’re not trying to make everyone do universal contract TM and nothing else. You can contribute work as you need, where you need, and everyone is there when you want to take the next step. You kind of can’t not contribute work at all though, because it’s supposed to be a system that always expands, so all fruits are its fruits and vice versa. Of course, it’s not like a billion people working at a nuclear plant, that would be chaos.</p>
  <p>“Can you at least give the most basic of sketches of how this would work in reality, if it even gets anywhere?” 1-2-3 spiral. Parallel existence, growth, meta-coordination. We establish the pattern, it grows by incorporation and cooperation, then it becomes infrastructural, and subsumes other extant structures. Repeat.</p>
  <p>“Can you at least give the most basic of sketches of how this would not be destroyed by the powers that be, if it even gets anywhere?” We’re not trying to do either reform, or revolution exactly. Of course, any individual, if they insist, might do that, but that’s not the main ‘project’. Personally, I am actually skeptical. Most likely, it will be like the Internet. It exists without anyone’s permission. Sure, it is not totally free, but the more you try to harm it, the more you are harmed. Probably, if technology continues to advance, it will find more of its breathing room through the opening up of new space through seasteading, greening of the Sahara, Space colonisation, … where it can have an existence truly independent of any currently actually existing states.</p>
  <p>Now that the basic basics have been established, what’s next?</p>
  <p>Spread this idea. Discuss it. Do whatever you want with it. Ideally, start your own stuff. Link up to similar communities. There is, of course, a central hub now, due to necessity. But before I proceed with that (again):</p>
  <p>If this gets anywhere, aside from bitter cynics, there will also be idealists with rose-coloured glasses. I also have to be very clear: especially at the beginning, you don’t get anything. You don’t get squat. This is super small too. There’s no guarantee of community, let alone money, let alone let alone success. Like 99 % of similar stuff, this will probably fail. If this somehow, miraculously, gets anywhere, and you want to be serious about it- you will face opposition, like anyone serious about anything. We also have no geniuses, gurus, etc. I am not a genius or a guru certainly, although I am transmitting this from someone who I maybe admire who I cannot disclose. We have no clear answers. There are a million ambiguities. Progress, if at all present, will be excruciatingly slow. You will be disillusioned a billion times. Actually, this starting point might become the very thing it opposes, although the spirit of the idea is ‘permanent’. This is probably impossible. We’re doing it anyway. If nothing, you’ll (probably) at least get a few decent chats about these topics. Maybe find some likeminded people.</p>
  <p>If you find any of this interesting, I’d love to see you at https://discord.com/invite/wvRxufhQpU Haters and critics welcome. Anyone who loves this idea welcome. Invite anyone. share this with anyone. Just be constructive. Also common sense stuff like don’t be a murderous psychopath.</p>
  <p>This is our first organising space. It also serves as a discussion space for all these issues. What I am looking for is also the first people who will, with me, write the first form of the universal contract, and hopefully ‘signatories’. Don’t worry, there are no tricks here, the basic form of the universal contract will be so high level that it can’t even realistically be enforced in court. There are genuinely zero risks at this point.</p>
