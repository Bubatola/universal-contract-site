<h1>Short introduction to the idea of universal social contract (USC)</h1>

<p>The universal social contract (USC) is a governance framework built on one principle: any system should constantly expand both its members and their rights. Humans, animals, ecosystems, future generations, ... eventually any agent capable of interaction. The idea draws from social contract theory, but makes it practical and real. Instead of a hypothetical agreement, it’s a participatory project of mutual care</p>

<p>The USC works through multiple levels. At the highest level, anyone can join simply by understanding and following the core principles. Below that, communities can form with their own specific practices, laws, and governance - as long as they remain connected to the expansive principle.</p>

<p>There’s no single canonical version or central authority. Different communities experiment, and over time they coordinate where their interests align. This creates both resilience (if one approach fails, others continue) and adaptability (communities can evolve as understanding grows).</p>

<p>Why would anyone participate? Because coordination creates real benefits. Expanding care means others expand care toward you. You get direct representation in shaping communities, you can leave anytime, and the system is designed to serve your interests by taking them seriously alongside everyone else’s. It’s not utopian - it will likely fail in most attempts, progress will be slow, and there are no guarantees. But it offers a way to work on governance that can accommodate different ethical systems, legal traditions, and ways of life, all oriented toward the same fundamental goal: expanding the circle of moral concern.</p>
