<h1>Visionary manifesto for a universal social contract - Eight Principles</h1>
  <p>PRINCIPLES FOR A UNIVERSAL SOCIAL CONTRACT</p>
  <p>PREAMBLE. We come together to recognize a hope. One that has existed before us, and will long after, that now awakes in us again. Spurred on by a thousand trials, we yearn to recognize a universal ethical life. We trust that righteousness guided with sincerity is duly rewarded, as it makes peace with the way of the Universe. To realize this, we propose principles we hope others may recognize:</p>
  <p>1. MUTUAL CARE. We know that to receive, we must also give. These are unbreakable circles. The larger our offering, the greater our satisfaction. We believe that all beings can thus be united, whether they are close to us, or far. We can never achieve the highest level of care, but that is why we come together in the promise.</p>
  <p>2. GROWTH IN UNITY. We aim to increase our circles of care, to increase our kin, to make a space for all beings, present, and those not yet here. At the far end, all circles are concentric, and all find themselves in a great brotherhood. This is our outward movement.</p>
  <p>3. GROWTH IN DIVERSITY. We understand that there is no unity without diversity. We accept different ways of existing, and relating, and try to make, or at least understand them, as if they were our own. This is our inward movement.</p>
  <p>4. ALL LEVELS. Every level of reality, and ourselves, grows from smaller parts, and contributes to greater wholes. We remember that all levels must be valued, and move towards their harmony, by knowing our own place. Those who recognize, must work together- self, community, world, whole. As above, so below.</p>
  <p>5. FREE TO ENTER, FREE TO LEAVE. We are aware of force in world, of conflicts, and estrangements. The ethical life exists for those who uphold it, and not they for the ethical life. We determine that anyone may congregate with us in some capacity if they are able to, and assent to these principles. At the same time, we impose no penalties for self-directed exit, obligations remaining only if previously accepted. We believe in that there is no true inside, nor true outside.</p>
  <p>6. THERE IS NO FINAL LAW. We have limits, and we do not know all. We stand in deep awe at how much we do not know about the world. We allow for better forms of the vision to emerge.</p>
  <p>7. SOUL, NOT BODY. The pact does not live in words, or any one person. It is our awareness, and recognition, which makes it true. We see ourselves here, and so we know we will see each other. It is more important to have awareness. We meet to remind ourselves that we share this awareness. We work on ways that can birth again, and preserve this awareness, in all times, all places. Failures are temporary.</p>
  <p>8. NO BONDAGE. We are guided by the spirit, not the letter. We understand that, to continue with our mission, we have to end that which we have begun. If our current vision for the ethical life fails, it must go. Idols are made to be broken.</p>
  <p>CLOSING. We hope that this will benefit all beings. Even when its final day comes, the seed remains. We will meet soon, right where we started.</p>
